# A class can inherit from another class
#
# Inheritance improves code reuse
#
# Constructor, attributes, methods get inherited to the child class
#
# The parent has no access to the child class
#
# Private properties of a parent are not accessible directly in the child class
#
# Child class can override the methods, this is called method overriding
#
# super() is an inbuilt function which is used to invoke the parent class methods and constructor
#
# Types of Inheritance - Simple, Multi-level, Hierarchical and Multiple inheritance
